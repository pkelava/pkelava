Hello everyone, I am Petar Kelava and I am undergraduate student at the Department of Mathematics, Croatia, Osijek - Math & Computer science program. 

I am interested in programming, mathematics and anything that requires logical thinking. 

Through my university years I have learned many programming languages (C#, C, C++, python, javascript, haskell, R) together with some of their frameworks (Angular, React, .NET) and I have also worked with the proof assistant Coq.
